                    <div> 1. Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) </div>
                    <img src = "../images/adalovelace.webp">
                    <p> Ada Lovelace is undoubtedly one of the most impactful women in STEM, more specifically computer science. She is often celebrated as the world’s first computer programmer!</p>
                    <p> She was raised by a poet father and a mathematician mother; her mother raised her with a focus on mathematics and science because she wanted to balance out her father’s poetic nature. Lovelace was tutored countless times by governesses and tutors her mother hired for her, until she met mathematician and engineer Charles Babbage by the time she was 17. </p>
                    <p> At the time, Babbage was working on an innovative machine called the Difference Engine, which had the intention of completing mathematical calculations automatically, and without error. Babbage enlisted the help of Lovelace to instead work on a more advanced machine called the Analytical Engine, which could theoretically perform any kind of calculation or logical process. This machine is often discussed as the world’s first model of a digital computer, as it had memory, a processor, and other essential functions that modern day computers have. </p>
                    <p> One of her most famous contributions was a detailed algorithm designed to calculate Bernoulli numbers—making it the first published algorithm explicitly intended for a machine, and earning her recognition as the first computer programmer. But her contributions extended far past programming! She had a profound interest in the absolute potential of the Analytical Engine, and theorized that if it could advance past arithmetic, then it could possibly even produce art, music, or other symbols. Although she could never prove her speculations, her thoughts alone prove that she was a visionary who was quite different from her engineering peers at the time. </p>
                    <p> Lovelace's work was not widely recognized during her lifetime, and she passed away at the young age of 36 in 1852, likely due to uterine cancer. However, her contributions were later rediscovered, and she is now celebrated as a pioneering figure in computer science and an inspiring icon for women in STEM fields. The U.S. Department of Defense even named a programming language, Ada, after her in 1980 to honor her legacy. </p>

                    <div> 2. Marie Curie (1867-1934) </div>
                    <img src = "../images/mariecurie.webp">
                    <p> Marie Curie was a chemist whose work in radioactivity not only furthered our understanding of scientific fields like physics and chemistry, but also advanced women in science everywhere. Born in Warsaw, Poland, she developed a passion for learning early on, despite the limited educational opportunities for women in Russian-occupied Poland. She pursued her studies in Paris at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. There, she met her husband and research partner, Pierre Curie. </p>
                    <p> Marie Curie’s most groundbreaking contributions centered around radioactivity, a term she coined herself. She first began studying uranium rays. Curie hypothesized that radioactivity was a property of atoms themselves, challenging what was the contemporary scientific understanding. With Pierre, she discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium and radium. This research not only advanced atomic physics, but also led to advanced innovations in medical treatments, specifically in cancer radiotherapy.</p>
                    <p> In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on radioactivity, making Marie the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. After Pierre’s death in 1906, Marie continued her research, taking over his position as a professor in the Sorbonne. In 1911, she won a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her work on radium and its compounds, becoming the first and only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. </p>
                    <p> Her work had an enormous impact, not only advancing our general scientific knowledge but also leading to practical applications in medicine. During World War I, Curie developed mobile X-ray units, often called “Little Curies,” which were used on battlefields to aid in surgery and injury diagnosis. Her dedication to science was so intense that her cause of death was due to aplastic anemia, likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. </p>
                    
                    <div> 3. Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951) </div>
                    <img src = "../images/henriettalacks.jpg">
                    <p> Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman whose immortal cells were taken without her consent, and eventually became one of the most important tools in medicine. Henrietta moved to Baltimore, Maryland as an adult, and in 1951, at the age of 31, she sought treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, one of the few hospitals treating Black patients at the time, for what she described as a “knot” in her womb. She was diagnosed with a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer. </p>
                    <p> During her treatment, doctors collected samples of her tumor cells without informing her. To their astonishment, her cells were a medical mystery: unlike other cells, which quickly died in lab settings, Henrietta's cells continued to grow and divide indefinitely. These "immortal" cells, later known as HeLa cells (derived from her name), became the first human cells to survive and reproduce outside the body, allowing them to be used in extensive research. </p>
                    <p> HeLa cells are still used today, and are valuable in research for a variety of reasons. Her cells continue to be used for toxins, drugs, hormones, and cancer cells. They have also been used in the cases of deadly diseases and viruses, and were helpful in the development of vaccines for polio and COVID-19. </p>
                    <p> Even though Lacks’ cells were and continue to be used for the betterment of medicine, there have been various ethical concerns over the usage of her cells. Neither Lacks or her family were aware that her cells were harvested and being utilized for medical research, nor did they know of the exceptional abilities her cells had. They therefore did not get any compensation, even though HeLa cells became commercialized. Finally, in 2013, her family was able to reach an agreement with the National Institutes of Health and have control over the usage of HeLa cells. </p>

                    <div> 4. Rosalind Franklin </div>
                    <img src = "../images/rosalindfranklin.jfif">
                    <p> Rosalind Franklin was a brilliant British chemist born in London in 1920. Her research was instrumental in the discovery of the double helix structure of a DNA strand. At a young age, she showed superb intellectual abilities, especially in the fields of math and science, and she eventually studied physical chemistry at Newnham College in Cambridge. Her most known work within the field of DNA started after the completion of her PhD, where she took on a research opportunity to study X-ray diffraction in Paris, leading her to later apply to DNA research. </p>
                    <p> In 1951, Franklin joined King’s College London, where she began investigating the structure of DNA using a technique called X-ray crystallography. She produced some of the clearest X-ray diffraction images of DNA, including the famous "Photo 51," which revealed the helical structure of DNA. Her miraculous work at this time was what enabled her to calculate key structural features of DNA, suggesting a double helical form with phosphate backbones on the outside. </p>
                    <p> However, Franklin’s contributions were largely overlooked during her life. Maurice Wilkins, one of her colleagues at Kings’ College, showed her Photo 51 to James Watson and Francis Crick behind her back. Watson and Crick used this critical information to construct their model of DNA, which they published in 1953. While Franklin was acknowledged in their paper, she was not credited as a co-discoverer even though she was the original discoverer! In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the DNA structure, by which time Franklin had passed away from ovarian cancer. </p>
                    <p> However, Franklin’s work explored much more beyond her DNA research. After she left Kings’ College, she started conducting research on the molecular structures of viruses and coal, which massively influenced subjects like virology and chemistry. Although she was not able to be credited for her work when she was alive, many people today (both in and out the scientific field) praise her for her groundbreaking research. </p>

                    <div> 5. Dorothy Vaughan </div>
                    <img src = "../images/dorothyvaughan.webp">
                    <p> Dorothy Vaughan was a mathematician, computer scientist, and served as NASA’s first African American manager during the mid 20th century. </p>
                    <p> During World War 2, she quit her job as a math teacher to work for NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), which was the precursor of NASA, located in Virginia. She was hired as a “computer,” which was a term used to describe individuals who were hired to do complex mathematical calculations. She joined a segregated all-black computing group called the West Area Computers. Despite the discrimination that she and the other Black “computers” faced at NACA, Vaughan excelled and became known for her precision and intelligence. </p>
                    <p> Starting in 1949 she became the first Black supervisor at NACA, leading the West Area Computing division. She advocated for fair, non-discriminatory treatment of her team, and helped ensure that the other black female mathematicians also received recognition and opportunities for promotions. Vaughan’s leadership of her group made her a mentor and idol to the other “computers,” who were also commended for their work, known as Katherine Johnson and Mary Jackson. </p>
                    <p> As NACA transformed into NASA during 1958, she envisioned the future of technological advancements within computer science. Vaughan taught herself and the West Area Computing group FORTRAN, which was an early programming language. She was virtually the sole reason why her team remained updated during the shift from manual to digital computations; she also worked on complex NASA projects including calculations for satellite and rocket launches, and space missions. Although she was not truly credited for her work, she gained wide attention along with the other “computers” through the movie Hidden Figures. </p>

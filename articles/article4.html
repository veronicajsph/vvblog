                    <div> 1. George Stinney Jr.</div>
                    <img src = "../images/georgestinney.jpg">
                    <p> George Stinney Jr. was a 14-year-old African American boy who was wrongfully convicted of murder in June of 1944 in Columbus, South Carolina. George Stinney Jr. and his younger sister Aime were outside playing when two white girls approached them asking for directions for a flower. That evening, when the girls didn’t return home, a search party was held, and George and his family participated. He mentioned having seen the girls earlier. The next morning, their bodies were found in a shallow ditch, leading to George’s arrest. </p>
                    <p> He was interrogated without his parents or an attorney, and the sheriff claimed that George confessed to both murders; however, there was a lack of evidence of this as a written statement of his confession was never provided. A mob had even formed to try and lynch George, while his family was being perpetually harassed by the townspeople. During the trial, he was given an attorney that had almost no prior experience with capital crimes. It took the jury all of ten minutes after deliberation to find him guilty. African-Americans were forbidden in the courthouse. </p>
                    <p> On June 16, 1944, George was executed at 14 years old, making him the youngest person to be executed through the death penalty in the US. At under 100 pounds, the guards mentioned that he had trouble fitting into the electrocution chair (made for adult offenders), and that the helmet would not fit his head, continuously slipping and “revealing the terrified, twisted, and tear stained face of a little child.”</p>
                    <p> His siblings had been maintaining George’s innocence for years, up until the motion to exonerate him from the crimes in 2014. A judge soon determined that, due to the lack of a fair trial and a violation of the Sixth Amendment, his conviction should be overturned. He was legally exonerated after seventy years. </p>

                    <div> 2. Central Park Five </div>
                    <img src = "../images/centralparkfive.jpg">
                    <p> The Central Park Five is a historic and widely controversial case of the wrongful convictions of five Black and Latino boys. In 1989, a white female jogger named Trisha was brutally assaulted, raped, and left for dead in Central Park. After the police monitored the park and found young teenage boys engaging in minor criminal activities, they arrested several, including Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Raymond Santana, who were all between the ages of 14 to 16. </p>
                    <p> At the time, the public relentlessly harassed these boys following their arrests. One infamous example is from Donald Trump, who posted a full page advertisement calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty and demanding that the boys suffer. He has yet to apologize. </p>
                    <p> The young teens were coerced into falsely confessing to the rape after enduring hours upon hours of psychologically intensive and aggressive interrogation from police, and were not given correct legal representation. Despite a lack of physical evidence, eyewitness accounts, and inconsistent confessions, the boys were convicted on the charges and all served multiple years in prison. </p>
                    <p> In 2002, their convictions were overturned when Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist who was also known as “The East Side Rapist,” confessed to Meili’s rape. DNA evidence proved that he was the perpetrator, and the Central Park Five were soon exonerated. They sued the city after their exonerations and in 2014, eventually settled for $41 million data for wrongful imprisonment. The police have still not taken Full responsibility for the misconduct and formally apologized. </p>
                    
                    <div> 3. Henry McCollum and Leon Brown </div>
                    <img src = "../images/henrymleonb.jpg">
                    <p> Henry McCollum and Leon Brown, half-brothers with intellectual disabilities, were wrongfully convicted in 1984 for the rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie in Red Springs, North Carolina. The case began when the young girl’s body was discovered in a field, and there was a rush to find a culprit. At the time of their arrest, McCollum was 19 years old, and Brown was just 15. Neither had any prior criminal record, and both had difficulty understanding the legal process. After hours of police interrogation, they were coerced into signing confessions written by law enforcement, confessing to the crime, though they had no involvement in it. The confessions became the backbone of their prosecution. </p>
                    <p> The trials were marked by significant flaws, including the absence of physical evidence linking either McCollum or Brown to the crime scene. Prosecutors relied on the coerced confessions, which were inconsistent and lacked key details about the crime. Also, despite their intellectual disabilities, there were no proper safeguards to ensure the brothers understood their rights or the implications of their confessions. McCollum was sentenced to death, while Brown received a life sentence. For nearly three decades, the brothers suffered in prison, McCollum facing execution multiple times as his appeals were consistently denied.</p>
                    <p> In 2014, after years of legal battles and efforts by organizations like the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission, new DNA evidence came to light that exonerated both brothers. The DNA found at the crime scene matched Roscoe Artis, a convicted murderer who lived near the area where Buie’s body was found and had a history of similar violent crimes. Despite the proximity of Artis and his record, he was overlooked by law enforcement at the time of the investigation. This revelation led to McCollum and Brown’s release after 30 years of wrongful imprisonment. Their exoneration not only cleared their names but also brought attention to the systemic failures in their case. </p>

                    <div> 4. Anthony Ray Hinton </div>
                    <img src = "../images/anthonyrayhinton.jpg">
                    <p> Anthony Ray Hinton, a Black man from Alabama, was wrongfully convicted of two murders in 1985 and spent nearly 30 years on death row for crimes he did not commit. Hinton was arrested after two fast-food restaurant employees were killed in separate robberies. He was identified in a photo lineup by another employee he attempted to kill, and was mentioned by another person as having interest in one of the restaurants that was robbed. </p>
                    <p> The police claimed that the bullets from both crime scenes matched a .38 caliber revolver found in his mother’s home. Despite having no criminal record and an alibi for one of the murders, Hinton was charged and convicted. Hinton’s court-appointed lawyer, working with extremely limited resources, hired a ballistics expert who was unqualified and could not properly challenge the prosecution’s forensic evidence.</p>
                    <p> During his trial, Hinton was falsely identified as the shooter, likely due to the problems with cross-racial identifications. He consistently maintained his innocence, but for years, his appeals were denied by Alabama courts. The prosecution’s case fell apart under scrutiny, but the system failed to correct their mistakes until much later. Hinton was essentially condemned to death because of ineffective legal representation and the reliance on faulty ballistics testing. </p>
                    <p> In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Hinton had received inadequate legal representation, sending the case back for retrial. The ruling opened the door for new ballistics tests, which proved that the bullets from the crime scenes did not match the revolver in question. With no remaining evidence tying Hinton to the crimes, prosecutors dropped the charges, and Hinton was finally released in 2015 after spending nearly 30 years on death row. His exoneration was a major victory, but it came at a tremendous personal cost, as he lost three decades of his life in prison for crimes he did not commit. </p>

                    <div> 5. Joyce Ann Brown </div>
                    <img src = "../images/joyceannbrown.jpg">
                    <p> Joyce Ann Brown, a Black woman from Dallas, Texas, was wrongfully convicted in 1980 for her alleged involvement in a robbery and murder at a local fur store. During the crime, two women entered the store, robbed it, and killed the store’s owner. Brown was implicated based on a car that was linked to her name and a witness who identified her as one of the perpetrators. Police also saw that she had a past charge of prostitution. Despite claiming that she was at work at the time the crime occurred, a valid alibi, Brown was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. </p>
                    <p> Brown’s conviction was based on faulty witness testimony and a case of mistaken identity. The store owner’s wife, who was also almost shot, identified Brown as her shooter, but Brown also worked at another fur store in Dallas, which was likely where the widow recognized her from. The actual perpetrator was another woman who resembled Brown, and had committed the crime but was not immediately pursued by law enforcement. </p>
                    <p> When a woman who was Brown’s cellmate at the time was put on trial, she testified that Brown admitted that she was one of the shooters, but it was never disclosed that she had been convicted of lying to law enforcement months before. Even though several witnesses testified that Brown was at work when the robbery happened, the prosecution concluded that she could have had time to commit the crime during her lunch break and return to work. She was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison.</p>
                    <p> However, her attorney from the organization Centurion Ministries revealed that the former cellmate had perjured herself by not revealing she was previously convicted for making a false statement, and that the prosecution was in the wrong for also not revealing that during trial. When one of the robbers was captured, she swore in an affidavit that Brown was not her accomplice. Brown was exonerated months later in 1989. </p>

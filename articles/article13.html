                    <p> Have you ever heard someone say, <i> “Wow, your English is so good!” </i> or ask, <i> “But where are you really from?” </i>— but you were born and raised in the United states? Questions wrapped in good intentions but laced with assumptions? These moments, often brushed off as harmless, carry a sliver of misunderstanding that can linger, even though they feel like they shouldn’t. They remind us of how different “we” are from “them”. For those whose identities are different from what is considered “normal,” these microaggressions aren’t just small annoyances, they are constant reminders of how we may never be truly accepted as ourselves. </p>
                    <p> Microaggressions are the small, often unintentional and unconscious phrases or behaviors that reveal a person’s inner biases, mostly towards marginalized groups. Despite their subtlety, these actions have significant psychological and social consequences, even though they are referred to as “micro”. In reality, microaggressions have the same amount, if not more, effect on a person of color’s mental health. Because of how quick and sly these remarks can be, we may feel uncomfortable calling out the person who did them. That’s why it’s so hard for people of color to come to terms with just how impactful they can be. </p>
                    <p> Kevin Nadal, a psychologist and researcher, defines microaggressions as "everyday, subtle, intentional—and oftentimes unintentional—interactions or behaviors that communicate some sort of bias toward historically marginalized groups." Unlike overt discrimination, microaggressions often go unnoticed by those committing them but are keenly felt by those on the receiving end. </p>
                    <p> At their core, microaggressions are rooted in implicit biases—subconscious beliefs that affect how people perceive not only individuals but groups of people. For instance, following a Black shopper just because you think they might steal something because they “look suspicious,” or the question, "Where are you really from?" posed to someone who is a U.S. citizen but perceived as a perpetual foreigner, reinforces exclusion and racial stereotypes. </p>
                    <p> Some other famous examples include assuming that a nonwhite person is a maid or other employee when really they are a customer, or complimenting them on being very articulate, implying that they are somehow better than their race, or perhaps even a gift. A lot of times, microaggressions can even come from people who are trying to be accepting or something of an ally. A white person who says that They can’t be racist, because they have Black friends, or that They don’t see race, because they are colorblind aren’t better than the ones who say more harsh things, either. They are denying people of color their experiences as people who aren’t white, or assuming that simply because they associate with nonwhite people means they cannot be racist at all.  </p>
                    <p> These repeated interactions, while seemingly minor in isolation, create an exhausting cumulative effect. They alienate individuals, chip away at their sense of belonging, and diminish their confidence in social or professional spaces. </p>
                    <p> Since the concept was first outlined in 2007 by Columbia University researchers, studies on microaggressions have expanded, offering new insights into their forms and consequences on others. New research has identified secondary microaggressions—responses to individuals speaking out against bias—that compound the harm even more. Examples include gaslighting (denying the bias exists), victim-blaming (faulting someone for their reaction to a microaggression), and speaking for others in ways that undermine their autonomy. These reactions not only further the original harm but may also deter people from confronting future instances of bias </p>
                    <p> This psychological research also highlights how intersectional microaggressions can be. Queer and trans people of color, for instance, face unique biases that are not captured by traditional measures. Even black and indigenous groups as a whole experience a different form of racism than other minorities, which are only worsened by microaggressions. </p>
                    <p> Recognizing and addressing microaggressions is a collective responsibility. Nadal emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and education. By understanding the personal experiences of marginalized groups, individuals can identify and challenge their own biases. </p>
                    <p> For educators, workplaces, and public institutions, they need to come up with strategies to combat the spread of microaggressions among peers. Teachers, for instance, can play a transformative role in reducing racial and linguistic microaggressions in schools. Anne Steketee, a professor at Millikin University, advocates for classroom strategies that build cultural awareness and foster inclusivity, which can have a profound impact on students' well-being and academic success. </p>
                    <p> And while microaggressions may seem like a trivial thing to get worked up about to some people, it is still important to recognize how these subtle behaviors continue to perpetuate stereotypes within our society. As Nadal puts it, "We all need to commit to working on these things in order to create a more harmonious society."  </p>
